Your task is to:

    Define a CashRegister class.

    Implement the methods of the CashRegister class based on the required functionality.


Requirements:

Methods

    The cash register should be able to:

        Add a product to a purchase.

        The cashier should be able to specify how many items of the same product will be purchased.

            By default, this value should be 1. 

        Show the list of products in the current purchase.

        Remove a product from a purchase.

        Update the price of a product after it has been added to the purchase.

        Find the subtotal of the purchase (before taxes).

        Find the total taxes for the purchase (assume that the store will charge 5% of the total purchase in taxes).

        Find the total amount of a purchase.

        Clear the previous purchase to start a new one. 

    Each one of the previous items should be implemented as a method in the class.

    Create at least three products with the format specified below.

    Call each one of these methods at least once with the appropriate arguments.

    Check if the output is correct and include it in your submission. 

Attribute

    The cash register should have the name of the cashier assigned to the cash register as an instance attribute.

Products

    A product should be represented as a dictionary with two key-value pairs (a key-value pair for the name of the product and another key-value pair for its price).

    For example: {"name": "Pizza", "price": 10.34}


Suggestion:

You could store products in a dictionary and add, remove, or update them. This dictionary could be an instance attribute of the cash register.
